# Brandon Password Generator Challenge 3

[Live deploy link](https://bwing2.github.io/brandon-password-generator-challenge-3/)

## Description

The challenge this week was to allow users to generate random passwords, based off of prompts. These included whether or not users wanted lowercase, uppercase, symbols, and/or numbers. This is the first JavaScript project I have done, and the hardest part was figuring how to structure everything. I learned a lot about the preperation that goes into creating an outline. I also learned the importance of pseudocoding before typing any code at all.

## Installation

1. Go to repository main page.
2. Click the green `<> Code` button.
3. Click the SSH button under the Clone heading, and copy the link.
4. Open the terminal.
5. `cd` into the location you want the file to be stored.
6. type `git clone`, and then paste the URL that was copied.
7. Press enter, and you should see a message containing "Cloning into 'directory name'...",meaning you are successful.
8. Open VS Code using `code .` and the copied repository should be there.

## Usage

1. Click the `Generate Password` button.
2. User will be prompted to enter an amount of characters greater than 8 and less than 128.
3. User will be prompted whether or not they would like lowercase letters in the password.
4. User will be prompted whether or not they would like uppercase letters in the password.
5. User will be prompted whether or not they would like numbers in the password.
6. User will be prompted whether or not they would like symbols in the password.
7. Password will be generated based off the options selected in the dashed textbox.
